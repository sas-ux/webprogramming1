    <h1>THE ROAD LESS TAKEN</h1>
    <p style="font-family:courier;color:red">Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br>
        And sorry I could not travel both<br>
        And be one traveler, long I stood<br>
        And looked down one as far as I could<br>
        To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>
        <hr>
    <p style="font-family:verdana; color: chocolate;">Then took the other, as just as fair,<br>
        And having perhaps the better claim,<br>
        Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br>
        Though as for that the passing there<br>
        Had worn them really about the same,</p>
        <hr>
    <p style="font-family:Courier New;color:blue" >And both that morning equally lay<br>
        In leaves no step had trodden black.<br>
        Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br>
        Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br>
        I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>

     <p style="color:green;"><u>Deep work </u> by <u>Cal Newport</u>is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.<br>
        <u>Shallow work</u> is non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style work, often performed while distracted.<br>
       <u> Deep work </u>is like a superpower in our increasingly competitive twenty-first-century economy.<br>
       <i><b>I build my days around a core of carefully chosen deep work, with the shallow activities I absolutely cannot
            avoid batched into smaller bursts at the peripheries of my schedule. Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and
            carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output.</b></i>
